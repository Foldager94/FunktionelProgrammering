## The principle of currying

> The Principle of currying is to make functions that takes multiple arguments when called, to a series of functions that takes a single argument
> Not curried:`f : (a,b) -> c ` <br>
> Curried:` f : a -> b -> c` <br>
> Curried functions allows us to take advantage of lazy evalutation and partial application
